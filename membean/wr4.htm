<h2>uni-</h2>
<h3>one</h3>
<p class="summary">The prefix <strong>uni-</strong> which means “one” is an important prefix in the English language.

<h2>contra-</h2>

To <strong>contra</strong>dict someone is to speak “against” what she is saying, whereas a <strong>counter</strong>clockwise direction is “opposite” of the normal way a clock’s hands usually run.</p>

<h2>eponyms4</h2>
<p class="summary">Eponyms play a smaller role than Latin and Greek root words in forming English vocabulary, but nevertheless are important for learning the word origins of English vocabulary. An eponym is an English word that is derived from a name, such as that of a person or place. Today we will explore three eponyms derived from the history of literature: <strong>serendipity</strong>, <strong>braggadocio</strong>, and <strong>bowdlerize</strong>.</p>

<h2>circum-</h2>
<h3>around</h3>
<p class="summary">The prefix <strong>circum-</strong> which means “around” and the Latin root word <strong>circ</strong> which mean “ring” both are influential in making up English words.

Clearly a <strong>circum</strong>ference is the bearing “around” a circle, whereas a <strong>circ</strong>le itself is in the form of a “ring.”</p>

<p class="summary">Morphology is the study of how words are put together by using morphemes, which include prefixes, roots, and suffixes.  Parsing the different morphemes in a word reveals meaning and part of speech.  For instance, the word “invention” includes the prefix <strong>in-</strong> + the root <strong>vent</strong> + the suffix <strong>-ion</strong>, from which is formed the noun “invention.”</p>

<h2>re-</h2>
<h3>thoroughly</h3>
<p class="summary">Some prefixes highly emphasize roots of words to which they are attached.  These prefixes can effectively be translated as “thoroughly” to highlight their intensive function.  For instance, the prefix <strong>re-</strong>, which can mean “back” or “again,” can also mean “thoroughly,” such as in the word <strong>re</strong>splendent, or “thoroughly” shining or bright.</p>

<h2>re-</h2>
<h3>back, again</h3>
<p class="summary">Prefixes are key morphemes in English vocabulary that begin words.  The prefix <strong>re-</strong>, which means “back” or “again,” appears in hundreds of English vocabulary words, for example: <strong>re</strong>ject, <strong>re</strong>generate, and <strong>re</strong>vert.  You can remember that the prefix <strong>re-</strong> means “back” via the word <strong>re</strong>turn, or turn “back;” to remember that <strong>re-</strong> means “again” consider <strong>re</strong>arrange, or arrange “again.”</p>

<h2>mal</h2>
<h3>bad, evil</h3>
<p class="summary">The Latin root word <strong>mal</strong> means “bad” or “evil.”  This root is the word origin of many English vocabulary words, including <strong>mal</strong>formed, <strong>mal</strong>treat, and <strong>mal</strong>ice. You can recall that <strong>mal</strong> means “bad” through <strong>mal</strong>function, or a “badly” working part, and that it means “evil” through <strong>mal</strong>ice, or intentional “evil” done to another.</p>

<h2>eponyms3</h2>
<p class="summary">Words from which eponyms derive play a smaller role than Latin and Greek root words in forming English vocabulary, but nevertheless are important for learning the word origins of English vocabulary. An eponym is an English word that is derived from a name, such as that of a person or place. Today we will explore three eponyms from the history of ancient Greece: <strong>Pyrrhic</strong>, <strong>spartan</strong>, and <strong>epicurean</strong>.</p>

<h2>ven</h2>
<h3>come</h3>
<p class="summary">The Latin root word <strong>ven</strong> and its variant <strong>vent</strong> both mean “come.” These roots are the word origin of many English vocabulary words, including pre<strong>vent</strong>, in<strong>vent</strong>, <strong>ven</strong>ue, and con<strong>ven</strong>ient.  When you in<strong>vent</strong> something, for instance, you “come” upon it for the first time, whereas a <strong>ven</strong>ue is a place to which people “come,” often for an e<strong>vent</strong>.</p>

<h2>ten</h2>
<h3>hold</h3>
<p class="summary">The Latin root word <strong>ten</strong> means “hold.” This root is the word origin of many English vocabulary words, including main<strong>ten</strong>ance, <strong>ten</strong>or, and <strong>ten</strong>acious. Perhaps the easiest way to remember this root word is through the English noun <strong>ten</strong>ant, for a <strong>ten</strong>ant “holds” the lease of the property where she lives.</p>
